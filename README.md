## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

This is the first time I have worked with Swift and XCode, so it took me a while to get used to them. The app has a lot of stuff, so it took a while to look for specific functions, especially learning how to build/run the app. However, after watching the introduction videos and trying out different features of XCode, I am intrigued by the interactiveness of the app. I love how we can develop our app with different features/elements and immediately see the result.

## App Brainstorming

1. Facebook
I love how different information is laid out in the app.
It also divides different parts of a user account into very clear parts, making the user experience great.
The algorithm to recommend posts to users is also extremely complex, and I find it to be perfect.

3. Premier League
The app has gamification features where we can play Fantasy Football. The GUI of the game is really nice; it gives a feeling that we are managers.
It also has a section for news and lineup updates.
There is also a statistics section to look at players' and teams' data to make lineup decisions.

5.  Bleacher Report
It is divided into multiple sections, including live scores, news, and games.
The scores are constantly updated, and the plays in a game are quickly documented, making it easy to stay updated.
I think it also embeds Twitter inside the app, showing live tweets from reporters.


I would like to build an app related to sports that can fetch data and update the GUI accordingly. It will also allow everyone to create accounts. Maybe people would be able to comment on sports games or watch the games together through the app. After the game, they can post their thoughts and share them with others. I would also like to add some gamification features and maybe a real-time leaderboard. If not sports, then the app can be anything related to entertainment or something that increases the efficiency of everyone's life.
